Often, the reason you got a question wrong on the exam is that you did not fully understand the concept.
Many topics in Java have subtle rules that you often need to see for yourself to truly understand. For
example, you cannot write a class that implements two interfaces that define the same default method unless
you override the default method in the class. Writing and attempting to compile your own sample interfaces
and classes that reference the default method may illuminate this concept far better than we could ever explain it.
